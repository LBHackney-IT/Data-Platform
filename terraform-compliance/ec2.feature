Feature: EC2

  Scenario: Ensure encryption on EC2 instance volumes
    Given I have aws_instance defined
    When it has root_block_device
    Then it must have root_block_device
    Then it must have encrypted
    And its value must be True

  Scenario: Ensure all data stored in the Launch configuration EBS is securely encrypted
    Given I have aws_instance defined
    When it has ebs_block_device
    Then it must have ebs_block_device
    When it has snapshot_id
    When its snapshot_id is false
    Then it must have encrypted
    And its value must be true


  Scenario: Ensure all data stored in the Launch configuration EBS is securely encrypted (launch_configuration)

    Then it must have ebs_block_device
    When it has snapshot_id
    When its snapshot_id is false
    Then it must have encrypted
