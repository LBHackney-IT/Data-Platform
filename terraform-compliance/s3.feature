Feature: S3
  Implemented
  - Data must be encrypted at rest (what if it's suppose to be public?, maybe check if it's suppose to be public before? What if it's mistakenly set as public?)
  - Data stored in S3 has versioning enabled


  Questionable checks (only checks if one pass)
  - S3 must have access logging enabled


  Scenario: Data must be encrypted at rest
    Given I have aws_s3_bucket defined
    Then it must have server_side_encryption_configuration


  # check if at least one s3 has logging enabled, because logging will require another s3

  Scenario: S3 must have access logging enabled
    Given I have aws_s3_bucket defined
    When it has logging


  Scenario: Data stored in S3 has versioning enabled
    Given I have aws_s3_bucket defined
    Then it must have versioning
    Then it must have enabled
    And its value must be true
