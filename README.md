Hackney Data Platform Infrastructure and Code

## Data Dictionary & Playbook

The Data Dictionary & Playbook can be found on the [Document Site](https://lbhackney-it.github.io/lbh-hackney-data-platform-docs/) and it's related [git repository](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-hackney-data-platform-docs)

## Architecture Decision Records

We use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architecture decisions that we make. They can be found in
`documentation/architecture-decisions` and contributed to with [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

### Hackney Infrastructure (Copy)

While in the initial phase of development, we have decided to manage our terraform in our own repository with the
future intention of potentially merging it into the infrastructure project in the future if there is relevant value add.

However, to ensure that we are using the shared modules contained in infrastructure we have used `git subtree` to include
the project code into this repository for reference.

To use the below commands, you will need to add the infrastructure repository as a remote:
`git remote add -f infrastructure git@github.com:LBHackney-IT/infrastructure.git`

Adding the repository for the first time:
`git subtree add --prefix infrastructure infrastructure master --squash`

To update the sub-project:
`git fetch infrastructure master; git subtree pull --prefix infrastructure infrastructure master --squash`

### Terraform Deployment

The terraform will be deployed using Github Actions on push to main / when a Pull Request is merged into main

### Terraform Development

### Local deployment

#### Set up

1. Create a env.tfvars file for local deployment, i.e run `cp config/terraform/env.tfvars.example config/terraform/env.tfvars` from the project root directory.
2. Update the following required variables in the newly created file:
  - `environment` - Environment you're working in (ususally one of dev, stg, prod or mgmt)
  - `aws_api_account` - API AWS Account to deploy RDS Export Lambda to (for instance ProductionAPIs account)
  - `aws_deploy_account` Primary AWS Account to deploy to (for instance DataPlatform AWS Account)
  - `aws_deploy_iam_role_name` - (can be left blank if assume_roles is set)
  - `google_project_id` - The Google Project to create service accounts in (for DevScratch `dataplatform-dev0`)
  - `assume_roles` - leave as an empty list if you want to deploy using SSO credentials locally (dev), or add `[true]` (keeping the value in a list) to deploy using Github Actions (Staging and Production)
3. For local deployment AWS needs a profile (assumed to be called `hackney-dev-scratch`) in and some profile configuration (which can be set in `~/.aws/config`). Read [documentation on Named Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) for more guidance setting up AWS credentials and named profiles.

```
[profile hackney-dev-scratch]
region = eu-west-2
output = json
```

4. Next run `make init` in the `/terraform`directory.
This will initialize terraform using the AWS profile `hackney-dev-scratch`.

#### Terraform commands

After runnning you can run `make plan`, `make apply` and `make destroy` to run the terraform deploy/destroy commands with the development `env.tfvars` set for you.
