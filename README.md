Hackney Data Platform Infrastructure and Code

## Data Dictionary & Playbook

The Data Dictionary & Playbook can be found on the [Document Site](http://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/Data-Platform-Playbook/) and it's related [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/Data-Platform-Playbook/)

## Architecture Decision Records

We use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architecture decisions that we make. They can be found in
`documentation/architecture-decisions` and contributed to with [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

### Hackney Infrastructure (Copy)

While in the initial phase of development, we have decided to manage our terraform in our own repository with the
future intention of potentially merging it into the infrastructure project in the future if there is relevant value add.

However, to ensure that we are using the shared modules contained in infrastructure we have used `git subtree` to include
the project code into this repository for reference.

To use the below commands, you will need to add the infrastructure repository as a remote:
`git remote add -f infrastructure git@github.com:LBHackney-IT/infrastructure.git`

Adding the repository for the first time:
`git subtree add --prefix infrastructure infrastructure master --squash`

To update the sub-project:
`git fetch infrastructure master; git subtree pull --prefix infrastructure infrastructure master --squash`

### Terraform Deployment

The terraform will be deployed using Github Actions on push to main / when a Pull Request is merged into main

### Terraform Development

### Local deployment

#### Set up

1. Create a env.tfvars file for local deployment, i.e run `cp config/terraform/env.tfvars.example config/terraform/env.tfvars` from the project root directory.
2. Update the following required variables in the newly created file:

- `environment` - Environment you're working in (this is normally dev)
- `aws_api_account` - API AWS Account to deploy RDS Export Lambda to (for developement purpouses this is normally dev-scratch)
- `aws_deploy_account` Primary AWS Account to deploy to (for developement purpouses this is normally dataplatform-development)
- `aws_deploy_iam_role_name` - This is the role that will be used to deploy the infrastructure (for development purpouses this is normally LBH_Automation_Deployment_Role)
- `google_project_id` - The Google Project to create service accounts in (for DevScratch `dataplatform-dev0`)

3. For local deployment AWS needs a AWS CLI profile (assumed to be called `hackney-dev-scratch`) in the profile configuration file (which can be set in `~/.aws/config`). Read [documentation on Named Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) for more guidance setting up AWS credentials and named profiles.

To set up this profile, you can use the AWS CLI using the following command:

```
$ aws configure sso
```

Your terminal should look like this:

```
SSO start URL [None]: https://hackney.awsapps.com/start
SSO Region [None]: eu-west-1
Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your default browser.
If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to authorize this request, open the following URL:

https://device.sso.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/

Then enter the code:
LDHD-CKXW

There are 18 AWS accounts available to you.
Using the account ID 937934410339
There are 2 roles available to you.
Using the role name "AWSAdministratorAccess"
CLI default client Region [eu-west-2]:
CLI default output format [json]:
CLI profile name [AWSAdministratorAccess-937934410339]: hackney-dataplatform-development
```

Install AWS-Vault

```
$ brew install --cask aws-vault
```

Generate Credentials for Vault

```
$ aws-vault exec hackney-dataplatform-development -- aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Initialise the Project

- Before you run, ensure:
  - You remove _hackney-dataplatform-development_ aws credentials if they exist in your AWS credentials file
  - You remove the _.terraform_ directory, and the _.terraform.lock.hcl_ file if they exist in the project's terraform directory

```
$ aws-vault exec hackney-dataplatform-development -- terraform init
```

Initialise your Workspace

```
$ aws-vault exec hackney-dataplatform-development -- terraform workspace new {developer}
```

4. Set up Google credentials

- Run `brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk` to install _Google Cloud SDK_
- Log in into Google Cloud by running `gcloud auth application-default login`
- The full path of where the file is saved will be displayed, for example `/Users/*/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
  - Copy this file to the root of the project by running the following command in the root of the project `cp /Users/*/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json ./google_service_account_creds.json`

5. Next run `make init` in the `/terraform` directory.
   This will initialize terraform using the AWS profile `hackney-dataplatform-development`. Before you run, ensure:
   - You remove _hackney-dataplatform-development_ aws credentials if they exist in your AWS credentials file
   - You remove the _.terraform_ directory, and the _.terraform.lock.hcl_ file if they exist in the project's terraform directory

#### Terraform commands

After runnning you can run `make plan`, `make apply` and `make destroy` to run the terraform deploy/destroy commands with the development `env.tfvars` set for you.
