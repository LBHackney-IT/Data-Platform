## Qlik Sense Enterprise vs Qlik Sense Server
The following module has been added as a duplicate of Qlik Sense Server. The only difference between the two is that 
this module will deploy a EC2 instance using the AWS Marketplace version of Qlik Sense Enterprise. The other module
will only deploy and EC2 instance with Windows Server, on which Qlik must be installed.

### Choosing
Hackney wanted to test both processes side by side, hence the additional module rather than a change to the original.
After a decision has been made, one of the modules will be deleted.
